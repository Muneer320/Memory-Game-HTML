# Memory-Game-HTML

Hey friend, this is a asic HTML game in which you would be given 3 by 4 large ractangle in which there would be 12 flipped cards and and all of them would be in pairs and you need to find the all the correct pairs by flipping them one by one and memorizing what you saw on the card.
The fun part is that it's a two player game so you can either play it alone or with one of your friends.
